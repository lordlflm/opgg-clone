## Developping
1. Install Rust
2. `npm install`
3. Create `.env` file and paste your riot api key as `RIOT_API_KEY`
4. `npm run tauri dev`

## TODOs
- too many icons arent found
- make match fetching async in main.rs
- participants rank
- champion level in team.svelte

## Ideas
- display top recently played champion for a summoner
- display most mastery champion for summoner
- undo/redo to go back pages like on the web
